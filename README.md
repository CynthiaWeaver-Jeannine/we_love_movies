This is a capstone project completed as a part of the Thinkful Engineering Immersion program.
The challenge was to set up a database and build out specific routes for users to access the data. 

The accomplished tasks demonstrate the following skills and abilities:  
[x] build complex servers  
[x] access data through a database  
[x] install and use common middleware packages, such as knex and cors  
[x] receive requests through routes, routing them to the appropriate endpoint or handler in the application.  
[x] running tests from the command line; all tests are passing ("npm test")  
[x] access relevant information, e.g., retrieve specific data and filter information  
[x] create an error handler for the case where a route does not exist (404, Not found)  
[x] build an API with RESTful design principles, e.g. CRUD operations with HTTP verbs and HTTP status codes.  
[x] create and customize a knexfile.js file  
[x] create connection to the database with Knex: 1. "npm install knex";  
    2. install the postgres driver with "npm install pg";  
    3. create a Knex instance, e.g., 'const knex = require("knex")...'  
    4. interact with the database using the Knex instance  
[x] write database queries to complete CRUD routes in an express server  
[x] return joined and nested data with Knex; examples: joins are in the "..service.js" files; nested example in update() in the reviews.controller.js  
[x] database connections using Knex's tools: examples: npx knex migrate:make <migration_name>; npx knex migrate:latest   
[x] deploying a backend server (utilized Render)

Additional rubric criteria included:  
[x] all tests are passing in qualified
[x] migrations can be correctly run and rolled back: tested with "npx knex migrate:rollback", "npx knex migrate:list", and "npx knex migrate:latest"   
[x] the seed command can be run multiple times: tested with "npx knex seed:run"  
[x] a response is included for "Method Not Allowed"  
[x] the cors package is included
